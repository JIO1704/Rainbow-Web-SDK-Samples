This demo is provided "as is" without support.

This demo demonstrates the use of the following Rainbow SDK for Web APIs:

- Connection Service: The demo shows how to use these APIs to connect to Rainbow

- Contacts and Presence Services: Using these services, the demo shows how to retrieve the informations from the contacts

- WebRTC Service: Using these APIs, the demo shows how to select the device to use and how to make an audio video call to a contact

Starting the demo
-----------------

The demo can be started using:
- index.html: Using this file, you will load the demo using the loader (Best way when starting a new application)
- index-noLoader.html: Using this file, you will load the demo without using the loader (Best way if you have already an application and you will integrate the SDK into it)
- index-jquery.html: Using this file, only the SDK will be loaded. You can then integrate it and use the API directory in our application (best way if you're not using Angular)
