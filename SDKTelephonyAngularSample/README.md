Rainbow SDK for Web

Preamble
--------
The Rainbow SDK (Software Development Kit) for Web is a pure Angular JavaScript library that works on all modern browsers from IE 11 to the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge. Its powerfull APIs enable you to create the best Angular applications that connect to the Rainbow Cloud Services.

SDK Angular Sample
------------------

This demo is provided "as is" without support.

This demo demonstrates the use of the following Rainbow SDK for Web APIs:

- Connection Service: The demo shows how to use these APIs to connect to Rainbow

- Contacts Service: Using these services, the demo shows how to retrieve the informations from the contacts

- Telephony Service: These APIs are used in the demo to manage telephony calls (make, take and release).

Starting the demo
-----------------

The demo can be started using:
- index.html: Using this file, you will load the demo using the loader (Best way when starting a new application)
- index-noLoader.html: Using this file, you will load the demo without using the loader (Best way if you have already an application and you will integrate the SDK into it)
- index-jquery.html: Using this file, only the SDK will be loaded. You can then integrate it and use the API directory in our application (best way if you're not using Angular)
